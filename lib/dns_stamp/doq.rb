module DNSStamp
  # DNS-over-QUIC stamps format:
  #
  # 0x04 || props || LP(addr) || VLP(hash1, hash2, ...hashn) || LP(hostname [:port]) || [ || VLP(bootstrap_ip1, bootstrap_ip2, ...bootstrap_ipn) ]
  #
  # addr is the IP address of the server. It can be an empty string.
  # In that case, the host name will be resolved to an IP address using another resolver.
  # IPv6 strings must be included in square brackets: [fe80::6d6d:f72c:3ad:60b8]. Scopes are permitted.
  #
  # hashi is the SHA256 digest of one of the TBS certificate found in the validation chain,
  # typically the certificate used to sign the resolverâ€™s certificate. Multiple hashes can
  # be provided for seamless rotations.
  #
  # hostname is the server host name which will also be used as a SNI name.
  # The port number is optional, and is assumed to be 443 if missing.
  #
  # bootstrap_ipi are IP addresses of recommended resolvers accessible over standard DNS
  # in order to resolve hostname. This is optional, and clients can ignore this information.
